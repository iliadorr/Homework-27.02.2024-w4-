2- List the components of the CPU and specify 3 functions of each

3- Explain and differentiate between Van Neuman and Havard architecture of Computer

4- Discuss about the best configuration/specification of a computer systems, we should consider when purchasing a new computer

Computer Architecture vs. Computer Organization:

Computer Architecture: Refers to the design attributes visible to the programmer, such as instruction sets, data types, and addressing modes. It deals with the high-level structure and functionality of a computer system, focusing on how the CPU operates and interacts with memory and I/O devices.
Computer Organization: Deals with the low-level details of a computer system's implementation, including the hardware components and their interconnections. It involves designing and optimizing the computer's internal structure, such as the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), control unit, registers, and memory organization.
Components of the CPU and their Functions:

ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):
Performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Executes logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) for data manipulation.
Handles comparison operations (greater than, less than, equal to) for decision making.
Control Unit:
Manages the execution of instructions by decoding them and generating control signals.
Coordinates the flow of data and instructions within the CPU and between other hardware components.
Synchronizes the operation of different CPU components to ensure proper execution of instructions.
Registers:
Store data temporarily during the execution of instructions.
Hold memory addresses for fetching and storing data.
Store intermediate results of computations and control information needed by the CPU.
Von Neumann vs. Harvard Architecture:

Von Neumann Architecture:
Uses a single memory space for both data and instructions.
Instructions and data are stored in the same memory, accessed using a single bus.
CPU fetches instructions and data from the same memory sequentially.
Harvard Architecture:
Has separate memory spaces for instructions and data.
Uses separate buses for accessing instruction and data memory.
Allows simultaneous access to instruction and data memory, enabling faster processing.
Considerations for Purchasing a New Computer:

CPU: Choose a processor with sufficient processing power and suitable for your tasks (e.g., gaming, content creation, office work).
Memory (RAM): Ensure enough RAM for multitasking and running memory-intensive applications smoothly.
Storage: Opt for SSDs for faster boot times and application loading, and consider sufficient capacity for your files and programs.
Graphics Card: Select a graphics card suitable for your needs, especially for gaming or graphic design work.
Ports and Connectivity: Check for the availability of necessary ports (USB, HDMI, Thunderbolt) and connectivity options (Wi-Fi, Ethernet).
Form Factor: Choose a form factor (desktop, laptop, all-in-one) that fits your space and usage preferences.
Operating System: Decide on the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) based on your familiarity and software compatibility requirements.
Budget: Balance performance and features with your budget constraints to get the best value for your money.
